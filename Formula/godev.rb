  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      godev changes your shell's working directory, which a child process cannot
      do on its own. It needs a small function defined in your shell.

      Set it up once:
        godev --init --install && source ~/.zshrc

      Or add this line to ~/.zshrc yourself:
        eval "$(command godev --init zsh)"

      Homebrew-managed installs do not self-update: use `brew upgrade godev`.

  test do
    # Catches version drift between the script and the tag it was cut from.
    assert_match "godev version #{version}", shell_output("#{bin}/godev --version")

    # The shell integration must emit a function that points at this binary.
    init = shell_output("#{bin}/godev --init zsh")
    assert_match "godev()", init
    assert_match "#{bin}/godev", init
  end
